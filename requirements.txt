# OpenPI Demo Requirements
# This file lists the core dependencies for the OpenPI demo.
# Follow the installation guide in docs/getting_started.md for complete setup.

# Essential dependencies used by demo scripts
numpy>=1.21.0

# Image/video processing (used by examples and scripts)
opencv-python>=4.8.0

# Data handling (used by training and evaluation scripts)
datasets>=2.14.0
h5py>=3.7.0

# Additional dependencies used by scripts
pathlib2>=2.3.0; python_version<"3.4"  # pathlib for older Python versions (Path used in scripts)

# Machine Learning dependencies (used by train.py)
# Note: JAX is included with OpenPI installation, but we specify minimum versions for compatibility
jax>=0.4.0  # Used in train.py for training implementation
optax>=0.1.0  # Used in train.py for optimizers

# Note: The following packages are installed separately per installation guide:
# - OpenPI: Clone and install from source (includes JAX, PyTorch, and other ML dependencies)
# - lerobot: Install specific commit with compatibility layer  
# - ROS 2: Only required for actual ALOHA hardware

# Optional: For advanced users who want to explore the full OpenPI training pipeline
# torch>=2.0.0        # Included with OpenPI installation
# torchvision>=0.15.0  # Included with OpenPI installation
# tqdm>=4.64.0         # Included with OpenPI installation
# Pillow>=9.0.0        # Included with OpenPI installation
# huggingface_hub>=0.16.0  # Included with OpenPI installation

# The demo scripts in this repository use:
# - numpy (for array operations)
# - opencv-python (for image processing in examples)
# - datasets (for loading HuggingFace datasets)
# - h5py (for data file handling)
# - jax/optax (for training implementation)
#
# Heavy ML dependencies (PyTorch, Transformers, etc.) are provided by the OpenPI installation.

# Standard library modules used but don't need installation:
# - argparse, json, time, logging, sys, dataclasses, enum, typing, pathlib, random
